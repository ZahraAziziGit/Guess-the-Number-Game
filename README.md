# GuessGame
### Work in progress
This is a simple number guessing game. A random number is chosen and players must guess the number. The game will be repeated untill at least one player guesses correctly.
This program is for practicing Java OOP. It is implemented in Java.

### Problems:
The Players' guess method creates a random number for each Player object, but the created number is the same for all Players.
